# STX Airtime Drip üí∞# STX Streaming & Airtime Drip



> Automate airtime payments on the Stacks blockchain. No wahala, no POS queues.I built this to drip Stacks (STX) safely from one person to another. It feels like how we do ajo/esusu back home, just automated on the blockchain. **Now with prepaid airtime drip for Nigerian networks!**



A decentralized payment streaming platform built for Nigerian merchants and customers. Lock STX once, let your people claim their airtime drops automatically ‚Äî like digital ajo/esusu, but on the blockchain.## What the contract does

- **Stream STX**: Sender locks STX inside the contract, receiver earns small pieces every block and can cash out what has accrued.

## Why This Exists- **Airtime Drip Plans**: Create recurring airtime payment plans for customers - perfect for merchants providing prepaid services.

- **Flexible Management**: Top up plans, cancel anytime, and withdraw remaining balance.

If you've ever run a small business in Lagos or Abuja, you know the headache: customers calling for airtime top-ups, chasing people down for payments, POS transfers that fail at 5pm. This dApp solves that.- **Multi-network Support**: Works with MTN, Glo, Airtel, and 9mobile.



**How it works:**All of this runs in `contracts/stream.clar` using Clarity.

## Tech Stack

- **Smart Contract**: Clarity (Stacks blockchain)
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Wallet**: @stacks/connect (Hiro/Xverse integration)
- **Styling**: Custom CSS (Nigerian colors: black, orange, army-green)
- **3D Graphics**: Three.js for animated background
- **Testing**: Vitest + Clarinet SDK


## Deployment

### To Testnet

```bash
# Deploy contract
clarinet deployments apply -p deployments/default.testnet-plan.yaml

# Update frontend config
# Create frontend/.env
VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<your-deployed-address>
VITE_CONTRACT_NAME=stream
VITE_NETWORK=testnet

# Restart frontend
pnpm run dev
```

### To Mainnet

Same process but use `default.mainnet-plan.yaml` and set `VITE_NETWORK=mainnet`.

**Warning**: Test thoroughly on testnet first. Mainnet transactions use real STX.

## Use Cases (Real Life)

1. **Airtime Resellers**: Automate daily top-ups for loyal customers
2. **Small Businesses**: Pay staff salaries in scheduled drops
3. **Parents**: Drip-feed allowance to kids without sending everything at once
4. **Subscription Services**: Manage recurring data/airtime bundles
5. **Savings Groups**: Digital ajo/esusu with transparent on-chain records

## Nigerian Networks Supported

- MTN Nigeria
- Glo Mobile
- Airtel Nigeria
- 9mobile

(Network identifiers stored on-chain; actual airtime redemption requires off-chain integration)

## Known Limitations

- Test suite has simnet wallet initialization issues (documented, not code bugs)
- Contract address must be manually configured post-deployment
- Stacks block time is ~10 minutes (slower than Ethereum/Polygon)
- No actual telco integration yet (requires API partnerships)

## Future Plans

- Direct integration with Nigerian telco APIs
- Mobile app (React Native)
- Multi-currency support (STX, xBTC, stablecoins)
- Email/SMS notifications for ready claims
- Plan templates and CSV bulk imports
